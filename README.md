# MyML - Machine Learning Projects & Resources

## About MyML
MyML is my personal collection of machine learning projects, research paper implementations, blogs, and resources. This site serves as a central hub for all my ML work and learning journey.

## Current Focus
- Diving deep into Computer Vision (CV) and implementing state-of-the-art papers
- Developing application-based ML projects

## Featured Blogs
- **ResNet & What It Solves**: An exploration of the ResNet architecture and the specific problems it addresses in deep learning
- **Logistic Regression: A Mathematical Perspective**: An intuitive explanation of logistic regression with practical examples

## Content
- **Research Implementations**: Code and explanations for research papers I've implemented
- **Projects**: Hands-on machine learning applications
- **Blogs**: In-depth articles on ML concepts and techniques
- **Resources**: Curated learning materials I find valuable

## Getting Started
Visit the site at [https://my-ml.vercel.app/index.html](https://my-ml.vercel.app/index.html) to explore all content.

## Future Plans
- More Computer Vision paper implementations
- Applied ML projects with real-world applications
- Expanding the resource library with useful learning materials

## Connect
Feel free to reach out if you have questions about any of the projects or would like to collaborate on ML research and applications.
